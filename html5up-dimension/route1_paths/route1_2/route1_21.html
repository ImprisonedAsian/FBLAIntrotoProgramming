								<h1>The Hunt Begins</h1>
								<p>You press yourself deeper into the alcove, forcing yourself to stay absolutely still. Your heartbeat pounds in your ears, loud enough that you swear the creature can hear it.</p>

                                <p>The thing shifts in the corridor. A slow, deliberate scrape of claws against metal. It knows something is here. It just doesn’t know where.</p>

                                <p>A mechanical click. Then another. The sound of sensors activating, scanning.</p>

                                <p>A soft beep.</p>

                                <p>Your heart stops.</p>

                                <p>Then—it moves.</p>

                                <p>Not away.</p>

                                <p>Toward you.</p>

                                <p>The air grows thick with the stench of rot and metal as the creature drags itself closer. A low, guttural clicking reverberates through the air, sending ice down your spine.</p>

                                <p>A claw taps against the edge of the alcove. Once. Twice. Then it stops.</p>

                                <p>It’s waiting. Listening.</p>

                                <p>You hold your breath.</p>

                                <p>Then—a shift.</p>

                                <p>It lunges.</p>

                                <p>You barely react in time, throwing yourself out of the alcove just as something slashes through the space where your head had been. The impact sends you stumbling onto the cold floor, hands scrambling for balance.</p>

                                <p>Behind you, the creature screeches. Metal shrieks as it tears through the alcove, its elongated form twisting unnaturally to follow you.</p>

                                <p>It knows exactly where you are now.</p>
