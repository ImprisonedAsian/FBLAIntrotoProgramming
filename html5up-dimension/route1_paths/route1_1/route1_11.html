								<h1>A Glimpse of Light</h1>
								
                                <p>Your lungs are burning as you throw yourself against the door, falling to the ground on the other side.</p>

                                <p>You scramble to the door, sealing it shut seconds before the creature reaches it.</p>

                                <p>Its shrieks shoot arrows through your soul. You try your best to drown out the terrible noise.</p>

                                <p>Looking around, you seem to be in an office. There's a sagging monitor and knocked-over chair to your right. A hint of dark red stains the chair, though you turn away before having to witness much more.</p>

                                <p>The monster cries almost turn to laughs. Its eyes, wherever they must be, are digging into your flesh. The door groans, its form shriveling as it gets closer and closer to giving away.</p>

                                <p>You eyes lock onto what looks like a security handbook. Desperate, you skim through it, looking for any fail-safe or weakness to this repulsive being.</p>

                                <p>The pages are rotted and smudged. Your trembling hands flip through the pages.</p>

                                <p>You land on one which describes the architecture of the facility. Somewhere, within the maintenance tunnels, a self-destruction terminal lies, only to be unveiled once all else fails.</p>

                                <p>The diagram also shows an emergency exit. The override code is listed as:</p>

                                <h3>7-1-3-9</h3>
                                <p></p>

                                <p>Its delighted screams grow louder. Picking up a stray pipe, you are resigned to fight.</p>
