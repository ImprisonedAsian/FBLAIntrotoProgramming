								<h1>Darkness Enveloping</h1>
								<p>Your muscles tense, and in a split second, you make your choice.</p>

								<p>You run.</p>

								<p>The creature screeches behind you, its claws scraping against metal as it lunges—but you’re already sprinting down the corridor.</p>

								<p>"Redirecting. Right turn ahead," ECHO instructs.</p>

								<p>You push yourself forward, lungs burning. The floor vibrates beneath you as the thing gives chase, its ragged breath growing louder, closer. You don’t dare look back.</p>

								<p>The alternate path appears—a narrow alleyway barely wide enough for you to fit through. You dive inside.</p>

								<p>You hear the wretched cries that emanate behind you but keep your eyes forward. </p>

								<p>Weaving through the ruinous passage, you find a strong metal door ahead. The monster is gaining on you.</p>

								<p>It's dubious you can keep ahead for long. It may be worth it to go through the door and hope for the best.</p>

								<!-- Choices -->
								<p><a href="route1_1/route1_11.html">Choice 1: Open the door and push through to the other side. Hopefully it is strong enough to hold the creature back.</a></p>
								<p><a href="../route2_paths/route2_1/route2_11.html">Choice 2: Keep running. You may find something new ahead.</a></p>
