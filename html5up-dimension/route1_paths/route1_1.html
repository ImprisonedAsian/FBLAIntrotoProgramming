								<h1>The Narrow Escape</h1>
								<p>Your muscles tense, and in a split second, you make your choice.</p>

								<p>You run.</p>

								<p>The creature screeches behind you, its claws scraping against metal as it lunges—but you’re already sprinting down the corridor.</p>

								<p>"Redirecting. Right turn ahead," ECHO instructs.</p>

								<p>You push yourself forward, lungs burning. The floor vibrates beneath you as the thing gives chase, its ragged breath growing louder, closer. You don’t dare look back.</p>

								<p>The alternate path appears—a narrow maintenance tunnel barely wide enough for you to fit through. You dive inside.</p>

								<p>The metal groans as the creature slams into the entrance behind you, too large to follow. It lets out a furious, inhuman shriek, its twisted limbs clawing uselessly at the walls.</p>

								<p>You keep crawling, heart pounding. The tunnel stretches on for what feels like forever until—finally—you reach another hatch. It slides open with a hiss, revealing a dimly lit chamber.</p>

								<p>“Path secured,” ECHO states. “You are safe—for now.”</p>

								<p>You collapse against the wall, breathless. You made it.</p>

								<p>But as you regain your composure, a disturbing thought lingers in your mind.</p>

								<p>ECHO knew exactly where to send you. It knew the creature wouldn’t fit. It always knew.</p>

								<p>Was this really an escape… or just another part of its plan?</p>
