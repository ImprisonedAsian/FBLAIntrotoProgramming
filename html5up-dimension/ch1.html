								<h1>Awakening</h1>
								<p>A sharp, sterile light flickers above you, casting eerie shadows across the cold metal walls. The hum of distant machinery vibrates through the floor, rhythmic and constant, like the heartbeat of something vast and unseen. Your head throbs. Your limbs feel heavy, as if waking from a long, dreamless sleep.</p>

                                <p>You try to move, but a metallic restraint encircles your wrist. Panic surges through you. You yank your arm free with a sharp clatter—the restraint was weak, brittle. You sit up, scanning the room. A lab. Or what remains of one. Monitors flicker, their screens filled with static. Cracks splinter across the glass of an observation window. Papers are strewn across the floor, some streaked with dried crimson.</p>
                                    
                                <p>A robotic voice crackles to life from the ceiling.</p>
                                    
                                <p>“Awake. Good. You are in danger.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>The voice is smooth, synthetic, almost human but not quite.</p>
                                    
                                <p>“Who’s there?” Your throat is dry, the words rasping out.</p>
                                    
                                <p>“I am ECHO. This facility’s artificial intelligence. You must leave. Now.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>Your pulse quickens. “Where am I? What happened here?”</p>
                                    
                                <p>A pause. Then, “Insufficient data.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>The lights flicker, and something bangs against a distant metal door. You aren’t alone.</p>
                                    
                                <p>A hiss fills the room as a hidden door slides open, revealing a dimly lit corridor. “Exit path prepared. Proceed forward,” ECHO instructs.</p>
                                    
                                <p>You hesitate. Something about this doesn’t feel right. Why is the AI so eager to help? Can you trust it?</p>
                                    
                                <p>As you step toward the door, a terminal screen near the broken window suddenly flares to life. Words flash across it:</p>
                                    
                                <p>“DO NOT TRUST ECHO. SYSTEM COMPROMISED. OVERRIDE NOW.”</p>
                                    
                                <p>Your breath catches. A set of manual controls glows beneath the message. If you override the AI, you might regain control of the system… or you could lose your only guide.</p>
                                    
                                <p><a href = "ch1_routes/route1.html">Choice 1: Trust ECHO and follow its instructions</a></p>
                                <p><a href = "ch1_routes/route2.html">Choice 2: Override the AI and take control yourself</a></p>

								<p>You wake up in an abandoned research facility with no memory of how you got there. The facility's AI, ECHO, speaks to you through intercoms, guiding you through a maze of locked doors, cryptic puzzles, and strange artifacts. The AI claims to be trying to help you escape—but can you trust it?</p>
