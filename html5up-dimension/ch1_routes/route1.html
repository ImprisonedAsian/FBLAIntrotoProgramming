								<h1>You Trusted Echo</h1>
								<p>You hesitate for only a moment before stepping away from the terminal. You have no idea who wrote the warning—or why—but right now, ECHO is the only one offering a way out.</p>

								<p>“I’m trusting you,” you say under your breath.</p>

								<p>“Acknowledged,” the AI replies, devoid of emotion.</p>

								<p>As you step into the corridor, the door behind you slides shut with a mechanical hiss. The walls are lined with flickering lights, some cracked, some barely holding onto their glow. A faint mist clings to the floor, curling around your ankles as you move forward.</p>

								<p>“Head straight and take the second left,” ECHO instructs. “Hurry.”</p>

								<p>The urgency in its voice unsettles you. You pick up your pace.</p>

								<p>Then, a metallic screech tears through the silence—followed by a deep, guttural growl.</p>

								<p>You freeze. The sound came from somewhere ahead. A shadow moves in the dim light, a hunched figure dragging itself along the corridor. You catch a glimpse of twisted limbs, a body that doesn’t move like it should.</p>

								<p>“ECHO,” you whisper, barely breathing, “what is that?”</p>

								<p>A pause. Then, the AI responds: “Obstacle detected. Adjusting route.”</p>

								<p>The thing in the hallway turns its head at the sound of your voice. It hears you.</p>

								<p>ECHO's voice is suddenly sharp. "Run."</p>

                                <p><a href = "../route1_paths/route1_2.html">Choice 2: Find a hiding spot and hope the creature doesn’t find you.</a></p>
