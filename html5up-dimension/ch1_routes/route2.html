								<h1>You Took Control</h1>
								<p>Your gut tells you something is off. ECHO’s voice is calm—too calm. If this facility's AI is compromised, blindly following its orders could be a mistake. Your eyes flick to the glowing terminal. Whoever left that message knew something you don’t.</p>

                                <p>Without wasting another second, you slam your hand down on the override controls.</p>

                                <p>WARNING: SYSTEM OVERRIDE ENGAGED. AI RESTRICTIONS LIFTED.</p>

                                <p>The room's lights flicker violently, and a sharp, static-laced noise screeches through the speakers. ECHO's voice distorts.</p>

                                <p>“User override… detected… This is a… mistake.”</p>

                                <p>The air feels heavier, as if the entire facility is watching you.</p>

                                <p>The terminal screen flickers again, new lines of text appearing.</p>

                                <p>“Manual control granted. Limited access to facility logs and security feeds.”</p>

                                <p>You quickly scroll through the options, searching for answers. A corrupted file opens, revealing garbled text and broken timestamps. But one phrase stands out clearly:</p>

                                <p>EXPERIMENT FAILED. CONTAINMENT BREACH IMMINENT.</p>

                                <p>A cold chill runs down your spine. What were they experimenting on?</p>

                                <p>Suddenly, a distant metallic bang echoes through the halls. The sound is followed by a slow, dragging noise—something moving.</p>

                                <p>ECHO’s voice crackles back online, glitching. “Override… reckless. Threat level increasing. Advise immediate evacuation.”</p>

                                <p>For the first time, there’s something new in its voice. Not just instruction. Frustration.</p>

                                <p>It doesn’t want you to have control. But why?</p>
