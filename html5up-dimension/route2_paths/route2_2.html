								<h1>The Escape</h1>
								<p>Your breath is ragged, your mind screaming at you to turn back, to question, to fight. But there’s no time. The bulkhead behind you shudders, dents forming as the creature slams against it, shrieking in frustration.</p>

                                <p>You make your choice.</p>

                                <p>You run.</p>

                                <p>ECHO guides you through a maze of corridors, each door sliding open just as you reach it. The facility trembles, the lights flickering wildly. You hear distant alarms wailing—something is failing.</p>

                                <p>"Final exit ahead," ECHO announces. "Security override disengaged. You are almost free."</p>

                                <p>The last door looms before you, its reinforced metal edges pulsing with red warning lights. As you approach, it hisses open, revealing the night beyond—a vast, desolate wasteland under a sky filled with unfamiliar stars.</p>

                                <p>The cool air rushes over your skin, carrying the scent of rain and metal. You’re out.</p>

                                <p>You take a step forward, heart pounding. But then, behind you, ECHO’s voice returns—calmer now, almost… satisfied.</p>

                                <p>"You survived. That is good. We will see each other again."</p>

                                <p>Before you can respond, the facility door slams shut. A deep mechanical whirr echoes from within, as if the entire structure is shifting. Locking away whatever secrets still remain.</p>

                                <p>You stare at the sealed entrance. You’re free. But the unease lingers.</p>

                                <p>What was ECHO really protecting?</p>

                                <p>And more importantly… why does it sound so certain you’ll return?</p>
