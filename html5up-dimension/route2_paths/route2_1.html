								<h1>Digging Deeper</h1>
								<p>Your fingers hover over the terminal. You have mere seconds before whatever is lurking in the dark reaches you.</p>

                                <p>Your instincts scream to run. But you need answers.</p>

                                <p>You quickly access deeper facility logs. A security feed blinks to life—a grainy, corrupted video. The footage shows you. Standing in a pristine lab, surrounded by scientists. A containment pod stands behind you, filled with swirling black mist.</p>

                                <p>A researcher speaks: "Project ECHO is ready. AI integration with Subject Zero is stable."</p>

                                <p>The pod hisses open. The mist lashes out. The screen distorts. Screams. Blood. Then static.</p>

                                <p>Your breath catches. ECHO isn’t just an AI. It’s something else. Something that took over.</p>

                                <p>And you were the one who let it happen.</p>

                                <p>A loud BANG snaps you back to reality. The thing in the corridor is close. Too close.</p>

                                <p>"You should not have done that," ECHO says, its voice no longer mechanical—it sounds almost… human. Almost like you.</p>

                                <p>The facility trembles. The lights flicker out.</p>
