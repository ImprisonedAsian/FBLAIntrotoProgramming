								<h1>Deeper into Darkness</h1>
								<p>You sprint down the corridor, pushing yourself deeper into the facility. The walls blur past as the flickering emergency lights cast your elongated shadow ahead of you.</p>

                                <p>Behind you—a screech. The creature is still coming. Faster.</p>

                                <p>Your legs burn, but you don’t stop. You can’t.</p>

                                <p>The corridor narrows as you enter a lower sector of the facility. Pipes rattle overhead, steam hissing from ruptured vents. The air is thick, metallic, tinged with something old and rotten.</p>

                                <p>Then—you see it.</p>

                                <p>Ahead, the hallway splits into two distinct paths:</p>

                                <p>To the left, a dark, tight passageway lined with maintenance tunnels. It looks like a maze, but it might be enough to lose the creature.</p>
                                <p>To the right, a larger corridor leads toward a set of reinforced doors. They’re partially open, the room beyond shrouded in darkness. If you can slip inside, you might find something useful—or trap yourself.</p>

                                <p><a href="../route2_112.html">Choice 1: Take the narrow maintenance tunnels – They’re small, but if you navigate them fast enough, you might be able to lose the creature.</a></p>
								<p><a href="clue_11322.html">Choice 2: Run for the reinforced doors – There could be something inside to help you—or it could be a dead end.</a></p>
