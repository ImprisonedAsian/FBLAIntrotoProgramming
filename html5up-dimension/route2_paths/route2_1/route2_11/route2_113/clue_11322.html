								<h1>Dead End, New Light</h1>
								<p>You throw yourself through the reinforced doors, forcing them shut behind you. Your fingers scramble over the panel, pressing the lock sequence. A heavy clank echoes as the doors seal.</p>

								<p>Your chest heaves as you step back, trying to process your surroundings.</p>

								<p>A dead end.</p>

								<p>The room is some kind of old security chamber—dust-covered consoles, shattered monitors, and rusting lockers line the walls. The air is thick, stale, carrying the scent of something long forgotten.</p>

								<p>Then—the first impact.</p>

								<p>A shudder ripples through the doors as the creature slams into them. Metal groans under the force. You spin, frantically searching the room. There has to be something—anything.</p>

								<p>Your eyes land on an old, flickering terminal in the corner. The screen is cracked, barely functional, but something faintly glows beneath the dust. You wipe it away with a trembling hand.</p>

								<p>A string of numbers blinks weakly on the screen:</p>

								<p>4 – 9 – 2</p>

								<p>What does it mean?</p>

								<p>Before you can think—another crash.</p>

								<p>The doors bend inward, deep gashes splitting through the steel. A high-pitched screech pierces the air.</p>

								<p>You’re running out of time.</p>

								<p>You spin back to the screen, looking for more. But the display glitches, the numbers distorting. Then—the power cuts out entirely.</p>

								<p>The room plunges into darkness.</p>

								<p>For a second, silence.</p>

								<p>Then—the doors burst open.</p>

								<p>The creature spills inside, its twisted form silhouetted in the dim emergency glow. Its hollow, gaping maw twitches as it locks onto you.</p>

								<p>You stumble back, pressing against the cold wall. Nowhere left to run.</p>

								<p>The last thing you see is its shadow engulfing you.</p>

								<h1>Bad End</h1>

								<p><i>(But you got a piece of the puzzle...)</i></p>
