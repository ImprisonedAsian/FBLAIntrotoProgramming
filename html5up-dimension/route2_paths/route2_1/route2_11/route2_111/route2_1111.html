								<h1>Veil of Steel</h1>
                                <p>The security door hisses open, its reinforced mechanisms groaning as they slide apart. You don’t hesitate—you dash inside, heart hammering, and slam the emergency lock behind you.</p>

                                <p>A sharp beep.</p>

                                <p>"Manual lock engaged."</p>

                                <p>The door seals shut, just as a thundering impact rattles the frame. You stumble back, breath caught in your throat. The creature is here.</p>

                                <p>Through the reinforced glass panel, you see it—twisted limbs clawing at the metal, its featureless face pressed against the window. It doesn’t screech. It doesn’t roar. It just… stares.</p>

                                <p>The room is pitch-dark, save for the emergency lights flickering along the floor. The air is stale, heavy with dust and disuse.</p>

                                <p>Then you notice it—this isn’t just a security checkpoint. It’s a control hub.</p>

                                <p>Rows of inactive monitors line the walls, some shattered, others frozen on distorted images of the facility. A large central terminal hums softly, a faint green glow pulsating on its screen.</p>

                                <p>And on the far side of the room—another door.</p>

                                <p>This one is older, rust creeping along its hinges. A faded warning label is barely visible beneath the grime:</p>

                                <p>"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY – FACILITY SYSTEMS CONTROL."</p>

                                <p>You approach the central console, wiping dust from the interface. A prompt blinks at you:</p>

                                <p>"SYSTEM ACCESS RESTRICTED. AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED."</p>
                                <p>"ENTER CLEARANCE CODE OR INITIATE FAILSAFE PROTOCOL."</p>

                                <p>Your pulse quickens.</p>

                                <p>This could be it—a way to shut the creature out for good. Maybe even access something deeper in the facility… if you have the right credentials.</p>

                                <p>But you don’t have the clearance code.</p>

                                <p>Behind you, the creature claws at the glass, its inhuman patience unsettling.</p>

                                <p>You need to act. Fast.</p>

                                <p><a href="">Choice 1: Attempt a manual bypass on the system – Risk tripping security protocols, but you might unlock something crucial.</a></p>
								<p><a href="">Choice 2: Forget the console and push forward through the rusted door – It might lead deeper into the facility… or a dead end.</a></p>
