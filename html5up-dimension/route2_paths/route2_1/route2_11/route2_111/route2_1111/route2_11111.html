								<h1>A Narrow Escape</h1>
								<p>It pounds on the door, taking its time with each strike.</p>
                                
                                <p>The calm, terrifying tempo of the clang of metal makes you twitch in fear each impact.</p>

                                <p>Your hands scramble over the keys, bits of dust scattering as you sift through the glitchy interface.</p>

                                <p>You click through files and programs, landing on the operations software.</p>

                                <p></p>

                                <p>In what seemed like hours, you eventually find the system override. Words appear in big, bold type:</p>

                                <h2>ENTER ACCESS CODE: █ █ █ █</h2>

                                <p></p>

                                <p>Wracking your brain, you try and find any information from your haunting memories of this place, looking for a 4-digit code.</p>

                                <p>Where could this have been? On a secret note? A security handbook? One of the thousands of flickering monitors?</p>

                                <p>Your trembling hands are barely able to hit the keypad as you enter in the code and hold your breath.</p>

                                <p>For a moment it goes quiet, as if the monster too is reveling in the suspense.</p>

                                <p></p>

                                <input type="text" id="passcode" name="passcode">

                                <div id="ending">
                                    <!-- If users enters correct passcode -->
                                    <p></p>
                                    <h1>Spectre in the Bright Night</h1>
                                    <p>You let out a shivering breath as the hatch clicks open.</p>

                                    <p>Stumbling to the door, you yank it open and throw yourself out into the dark, open world.</p>

                                    <p>Behind you, you hear the thump of heavy metal falling into place.</p> 

                                    <p>The echoes of the monster's voice linger in your head.</p>

                                    <p>For now, the threat is contained.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>You sit there in the soft grass for what feels like an hour, listening to your ragged breaths.</p>

                                    <p>Weakly, you get to your feet. Looking out at the barren expanse, you know your journey is far from over.</p>

                                    <p>You walk in slow, exhausted steps in a random direction, hoping to find sanctuary in a vehicle or small town.</p>

                                    <p>Your mind swirls with loud, unignorable questions.</p>

                                    <p>The monster has been contained for now, but the relentless hand of time will eventually come to set it free.</p>

                                    <p>Sitting down in a small shelter made from rocks and leaves, you drift in to a restless sleep.</p>

                                    <h1>An END.</h1>
                                </div>

                                <div id="bad-ending">
                                    <!-- If user enters incorrect passcode -->
                                    <p></p>

                                    <h1>No One Can Hear You</h1>
                                    <p>The screen blares red.</p>

                                    <p>You try again and again, practically clawing at the keypad, screaming at it to set you free.</p>

                                    <p>The monster watches from behind.</p>

                                    <p>Even in its scrambled face, you see its sadistic glee.</p>

                                    <p>You crumple down beside the control terminal. Nothing more can be done.</p>

                                    <p>Looking at it, you smile.</p>

                                    <p>The door bursts open.</p>

                                    <p>Before you could blink, it was already around your neck.</p>

                                    <p>You don't scream. The monster doesn't get that satisfaction.</p>

                                    <p>Liberating pain fills your senses as you crumple down.</p>
