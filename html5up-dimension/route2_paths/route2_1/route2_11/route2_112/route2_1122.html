								<h1>Shoot Through the Heart</h1>
								<p>You push deeper into the tunnels, lungs burning, feet pounding against the metal grates as the creature’s inhuman screeches echo behind you.</p>

                                <p>The emergency lighting flickers erratically, casting jagged shadows along the walls. The tunnels feel wrong—no longer just maintenance corridors but something else, something deliberately hidden beneath the facility.</p>

                                <p>A sudden tremor rumbles through the floor. The facility is unstable. Time is running out.</p>

                                <p>Then—you see it.</p>

                                <p>A blast door, partially forced open, leading into a darkened control room. You don’t hesitate. You dive inside.</p>

                                <p>Inside the Control Room
                                <p>The air is thick with dust, the scent of old electronics and rusted metal filling your lungs. Rows of monitors flicker, corrupted data scrolling across their cracked screens. Error messages flash, system warnings overlapping each other in a chaotic mess.</p>

                                <p>Then—a repeating message over the speakers:</p>

                                <p>"Containment breach detected."</p>
                                <p>"Security clearance required to engage protocol."</p>
                                <p>"Enter final authorization code."</p>

                                <p>Your stomach twists. You know what this is. A last resort.</p>

                                <p>Your eyes lock onto the center console. A keypad glows faintly, waiting for input. Below it, a warning label, barely legible under layers of grime:</p>

                                <p>"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY – SYSTEM PURGE WILL INITIATE FACILITY-WIDE DESTRUCTION."</p>

                                <p>A self-destruct sequence.</p>

                                <p>Behind you, the sound of metal twisting and snapping. The creature is forcing its way through the door.</p>

                                <p>There’s no other way out.</p>

                                <p>Your mind races, piecing together the numbers you’ve seen—the codes left behind, the patterns scrawled in hidden places. It was never a passcode for escape. It was this.</p>

                                <p>Your hands hover over the keypad. The facility is compromised. If this thing gets out… it won’t stop here.</p>

                                <p>You take a breath.</p>

                                <p>And start entering the code.</p>

                                <p><a href="../../../../gen_endings/password.html">Choice 1: Complete the self-destruct sequence – Seal the creature inside, ensuring it never escapes… but can you escape in time?</a></p>
								<p><a href="clue_11322.html">Choice 2: Hesitate, looking for another way out – There might be a way to survive without destroying the facility… but every second wasted brings the creature closer.</a></p>
