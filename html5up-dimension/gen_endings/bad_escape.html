								<h1>Unleashed</h1>
								<p>You throw yourself forward, diving beneath the narrowing gap of the blast door just as the creature lunges.</p>

                                <p>For a moment, you think you’ve escaped.</p>

                                <p>You slam your palm against the control panel, willing the decayed system to respond. The blast door groans, gears shrieking, before finally slamming shut with a heavy THUD.</p>

                                <p>Silence.</p>

                                <p>You stagger back, chest heaving. It’s trapped.</p>

                                <p>Then—the metal buckles.</p>

                                <p>Your stomach drops.</p>

                                <p>A deafening, rage-fueled screech rips through the air as the creature slams against the blast door. The reinforced steel bulges outward, deep claw marks carving through the surface like it’s nothing.</p>

                                <p>The lockdown system was never meant to hold something like this.</p>

                                <p>With a final, sickening crunch, the door bursts apart.</p>

                                <p>You run.</p>

                                <p>But it’s not chasing you anymore.</p>

                                <p>Instead, it turns away.</p>

                                <p>Toward the distant, crumbling exit gates.</p>

                                <p>The facility’s main security doors—ajar.</p>

                                <p>Your breath catches in your throat. No.</p>

                                <p>It shrieks in triumph before launching itself forward, its twisted form moving with horrifying speed.</p>

                                <p>You sprint after it, but your legs feel like lead. The emergency lights flash red—breach detected—but no alarms will stop it now.</p>

                                <p>By the time you reach the ruined security gates, it’s already outside.</p>

                                <p>The air is thick, the sky painted in the dying hues of dusk. The wind howls across the desolate landscape. But the creature doesn’t hesitate.</p>

                                <p>It disappears into the wilderness.</p>

                                <p>Your knees buckle. A wave of nausea washes over you as the horrifying truth sinks in.</p>

                                <p>This facility was never just some abandoned relic. It was a prison.</p>

                                <p>And you just let the world’s worst nightmare escape.</p>

                                <p>Somewhere, beyond the hills, past the broken roads and empty towns… people still exist.</p>

                                <p>They don’t know what’s coming.</p>

                                <p>But they will.</p>
