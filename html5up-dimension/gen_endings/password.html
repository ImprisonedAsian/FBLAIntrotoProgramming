								<h1>The Escape</h1>
								<p>The terminal hums weakly, its cracked screen flickering as it struggles to power on. You step closer, your breath shallow, fingers hovering over the dusty keyboard.</p>

                                <p>A prompt blinks in the dim glow:</p>

                                <p>ENTER ACCESS CODE: █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █</p>

                                <p>Your mind races. Somewhere along the way, you’ve seen numbers—scrawled on walls, flickering on broken screens, whispered in dying radio transmissions. Pieces of a puzzle you didn’t even know you were solving.</p>

                                <p>You wipe the sweat from your brow. You only get one chance.</p>

                                <p>The echoes of distant movement remind you that you’re not alone. The air is thick with the scent of rust and decay, and every second spent here is a risk.</p>

                                <p>Your fingers hover over the keys.</p>

                                <p>This is it.</p>

                                <p>The difference between escape… or the end.</p>

                                <input type="text" id="passcode" name="passcode">

                                <div id="ending">
                                    <p></p>
                                    <h1>Purge Their Secrets</h1>
                                    <p>Your fingers fly across the keypad, punching in the numbers you’ve pieced together. Each entry echoes in the silent control room, the machine hesitating for a brief second before confirming the input.</p>

                                    <p>"Authorization Code Accepted."</p>

                                    <p>A deep, mechanical hum reverberates through the walls.</p>

                                    <p>Then—the voice returns, colder, final.</p>

                                    <p>"Facility-wide purge sequence initiated. All personnel evacuate immediately. Countdown commencing."</p>

                                    <h3>10…</h3>

                                    <p>Behind you, the reinforced blast door ruptures, metal screeching as the creature forces its way through. Its twisting, unnatural limbs slither forward, its hollow eyes locking onto you.</p>

                                    <h3>9…</h3>

                                    <p>You slam your fist against the console, forcing the override. Red warning lights flash violently, illuminating the room in eerie, pulsing shadows.</p>

                                    <h3>8…</h3>

                                    <p>The creature lunges.</p>

                                    <p>You dive to the side, its jagged claws tearing through the console, sending sparks flying. But it’s too late. The system is locked in.</p>

                                    <h3>7…</h3>

                                    <p>You sprint toward an emergency access ladder, barely visible through the flickering light. The metal is slick with condensation, your grip unsteady as you haul yourself upward.</p>

                                    <h3>6…</h3>

                                    <p>Below, the creature writhes and shrieks, its body thrashing violently as automated security barriers slam down, trapping it inside.</p>

                                    <h3>5…</h3>

                                    <p>Pipes burst, releasing clouds of searing steam, the facility tearing itself apart from within. The tunnel shakes, debris raining down as you climb higher, faster.</p>

                                    <h3>4…</h3>

                                    <p>The final emergency hatch comes into view. You throw your weight against it, forcing it open, the cold night air rushing in.</p>

                                    <h3>3…</h3>

                                    <p>The ground trembles beneath you as you stagger outside, emerging onto a cracked, desolate landscape. Above, the night sky stretches wide, empty, open—your first glimpse of freedom.</p>

                                    <h3>2…</h3>

                                    <p>Behind you, deep within the facility, something screams. A deafening, inhuman wail—then, silence.</p>

                                    <h3>1…</h3>

                                    <p>The ground erupts.</p>

                                    <p>A shockwave slams into your back, throwing you forward as the entire facility collapses inward, consumed by fire and destruction. The remains of the nightmare you escaped are buried beneath the rubble.</p>

                                    <p>You lie there for a moment, staring up at the stars, your chest heaving, lungs filled with the crisp air of the outside world.</p>

                                    <p>You survived.</p>

                                    <h1>END.</h1>
                                </div>

                                <div id="bad-ending">
                                    <p></p>

                                    <h1>Protocol Failure</h1>

                                    <p>Your hands tremble over the keypad. The numbers—you’ve seen them, scattered across the facility, but now, under pressure, they blur together.</p>

                                    <p>You try to focus. You punch in a code—error.</p>

                                    <p>"Invalid input. Please try again."</p>

                                    <p>The creature slams into the doorway, its grotesque form writhing and twisting as it forces its way inside.</p>

                                    <p>You try again. Another set of numbers—error.</p>

                                    <p>"Invalid input. One attempt remaining."</p>

                                    <p>The room shakes, warning lights casting jagged shadows as the beast creeps closer, its hollow, gleaming eyes fixed on you.</p>

                                    <p>Your breath catches. You stab the keypad again—</p>

                                   <p>ERROR.</p>

                                   <p>The screen flickers red.</p>

                                   <p>"Authentication failed. System override disabled."</p>

                                   <p>A sharp click echoes through the room—the console has locked you out.</p>

                                   <p>You whirl around, desperate for another way out, but it’s too late.</p>

                                   <p>The creature lunges.</p>

                                   <p>You barely have time to react before its claws sink deep into your chest, lifting you off your feet like a ragdoll. Agony floods your body, your vision blurring as you struggle against its impossible strength.</p>

                                   <p>The last thing you hear is the sound of your own ragged breath, fading beneath the creature’s horrific, guttural screech.</p>

                                   <p>Then—darkness.</p>
