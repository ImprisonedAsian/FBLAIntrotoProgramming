								<h1>The Escape</h1>
								<p>The terminal hums weakly, its cracked screen flickering as it struggles to power on. You step closer, your breath shallow, fingers hovering over the dusty keyboard.</p>

                                <p>A prompt blinks in the dim glow:</p>

                                <p>ENTER ACCESS CODE: █ █ █ █</p>

                                <p>Your mind races. Somewhere along the way, you’ve seen numbers—scrawled on walls, flickering on broken screens, whispered in dying radio transmissions. Pieces of a puzzle you didn’t even know you were solving.</p>

                                <p>You wipe the sweat from your brow. You only get one chance.</p>

                                <p>The echoes of distant movement remind you that you’re not alone. The air is thick with the scent of rust and decay, and every second spent here is a risk.</p>

                                <p>Your fingers hover over the keys.</p>

                                <p>This is it.</p>

                                <p>The difference between escape… or the end.</p>

                                <input type="text" id="passcode" name="passcode">

                                <div id="ending">
                                    <p></p>
                                    <h1>The Truth Unlocked</h1>
                                    <p>Your hands tremble as you type in the numbers, each keystroke echoing through the silent room. The monitor flickers—processing.</p>

                                    <p>Then—a sharp beep.</p>

                                    <p>The screen shifts. Lines of ancient code scroll rapidly, unlocking something deep within the system. Then, at last—</p>

                                    <h3>ACCESS GRANTED.</h3>

                                    <p>A metallic hiss fills the room. Across from you, a hidden panel slides open, revealing a reinforced passageway bathed in dim, blue emergency lights. A way out.</p>

                                    <p>Behind you, the distant screech of the creature reverberates through the facility. It knows where you are. It’s coming.</p>

                                    <p>You don’t wait. You lunge forward, slipping into the passage just as the door seals shut behind you. The walls shake as something slams against it from the other side—but the barrier holds.</p>

                                    <p>For the first time in what feels like forever, you exhale.</p>

                                    <p>The corridor ahead is silent, untouched. At the end, another door unlocks automatically, leading to something you never expected—</p>

                                    <p>The Outside.</p>

                                    <p>A sky. A real, open sky. Cold air rushes against your face, the scent of earth and rain filling your lungs. After so long trapped in the depths of the facility, the world beyond feels alien—but it’s real. You made it.</p>

                                    <p>Behind you, the facility shudders—alarms wailing as automated lockdown protocols activate. Whatever was inside, whatever horror you left behind… it won’t be escaping with you.</p>

                                    <p>You step forward, leaving the nightmare behind.</p>
